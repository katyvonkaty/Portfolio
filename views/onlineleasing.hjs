                    <h1>Online Leasing </h1>
                      <p> Renting an apartment can be a challenging experience in NYC. Add in roommates, pets and guarantors and the leasing journey can feel like a really long and frustrating process. </p>

                <h3> Today’s Solution </h3>
                <p>After going through different rental websites(airbnb, homeaway), I saw major UX problems in many of them. I chose to focus on the experience in one of the biggest cities in the world - NYC. The problem we wanted to fix was simplying the rental process to be a quick and transparent interaction.</p>

                    <h1>User Stories + Pain Points </h1>
                   <p>
                  In order to build realistic user stories, we tested 15 people from craigslist who had apartment hunted and signed a lease within the past 2 years.</p> 
                  <h3> Main takeaways:</h3>
                  <p>
                  The current app does not support any of the user stories really well. It forces the user to give all the exact details (specific movie, specific theater, specific date, specific hour) before seeing if the screening is available / not available.<br>
                  <strong> 6/10 complained that the process feels long.</strong><br>
                  <strong> 4/10 complained about not clarity as to where they were in the leasing process. </strong> <br>
                  <strong> 2/10 Complained about having to pay extra fees they didn’t expect. </strong> <br>
                  <strong> Other complaints mentioned the app’s low speed or bugs.</strong>

                    <h1>Testing + Closing Thoughts </h1>
                      <p>

                To test this solution, we created a script: try to lease an apartment knowing you have 2 roomates, 1 animal and 1 guarantor.

                Our testers were successful doing that, but it still doesn’t mean much :) It only means that it’s not too complicated. This is an MVP tested on very few people, and in the real world there are many more things to consider and monitor.

                If leasing companies had more awareness to user experience, I’m sure more people wouldn't need therapy after renting an apartment. Maybe with this change, next time a new cool unit  comes out, I might actually find someone who’d like to sign the lease with me. </p>
